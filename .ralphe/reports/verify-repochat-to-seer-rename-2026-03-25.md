# Verification: Rename app/package identity from repochat to seer

**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Status:** PASS (with caveats)

## Summary

The core app/package identity has been correctly renamed from `repochat` to `seer`. All primary identity surfaces now report `seer`. The rename is present in the working tree (unstaged/uncommitted) as a directory move from `apps/repochat/` to `apps/seer/`.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ App/package identity renamed from repochat to seer
- Directory: `apps/repochat/` → `apps/seer/` ✓
- `package.json` name: `"seer"` ✓
- Agent name: `"seer"` in `agent.ts` (`makeSeerAgent`) ✓
- System prompt: `"You are Seer, a codebase exploration assistant."` ✓
- Effect service tag: `SeerAgent` ✓

### ✅ Startup and health/service identity surfaces report seer
- Health endpoint: `{ ok: true, service: "seer" }` in `handler.ts:32` ✓
- Log prefix: `[seer]` in `log.ts:9` ✓
- Module doc comment: `"Seer — codebase exploration chat service."` in `index.ts:2` ✓
- Config doc comment: `"Seer configuration."` in `config.ts:2` ✓
- Memory doc comment: `"Seer memory configuration."` in `memory.ts:2` ✓
- Memory instance: `"Concrete Memory instance for the seer agent"` in `memory.ts:69` ✓

### ✅ Workspace/package references use seer consistently
- `pnpm --filter seer` runs correctly (tested: `test`, `typecheck`) ✓
- Package name in `apps/seer/package.json`: `"seer"` ✓
- No JSON files reference `repochat` ✓

### ✅ No product behavior changes beyond the rename
- All 117 unit tests pass (`pnpm --filter seer test`) ✓
- Typecheck passes (`pnpm --filter seer typecheck`) ✓

## Test Results
- **Unit tests:** 117 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped
- **Typecheck:** Clean, no errors
- **Startup:** Fails only due to missing `GOOGLE_CHAT_CREDENTIALS` (expected in local env without credentials configured — not a rename issue)

## Remaining `repochat` references (out of scope for this slice)

Per the task notes, this slice is "the canonical naming foundation" and later slices will cover env vars, docs, and test renames. The following 89 occurrences across 11 files are expected to remain:

| Category | Files | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Env vars | `config.ts`, `memory.ts`, `tools/read-file.ts` | 9 | `REPOCHAT_TRACKED_BRANCH`, `REPOCHAT_REPO_ROOT`, `REPOCHAT_MEMORY_DB_URL` |
| Test fixtures | 7 test files | 77 | env var references in tests |
| Docs | `README.md`, `.env.example` | 3 | Documentation references |

These are explicitly deferred to env-var and docs rename slices per the parent PRD.

## Conclusion

The canonical app/package identity rename from `repochat` to `seer` is correctly implemented. All primary identity surfaces (package name, directory, health endpoint, log prefix, agent name, system prompt, doc comments) consistently use `seer`. Tests pass, typecheck is clean, and no behavioral changes were introduced.
